### Faith
I want to do this bit justice, so I will not rush it now.

### Software
I have been a software developer for quite a while, you can see my employment history on LinkedIn. I have worked in small companies with under 10 employees to a trading fund of the MOD with over 1300 employees and I have worked on my own and in teams of up to 8. All the companies I have worked for have had good points and bad points and I have formed some strong opinions accordingly.

### Music
I love music. I love the creativity and collaboration. I love a funky groove where drummer and bassist are clearly having fun! 
I play 6 string bass fairly well, I dabble with guitars and keyboards and very occaisionally with drums/cajon etc. I also sing and I play regularly at church.
I love music technology, whether its live sound or recording.
