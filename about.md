Hi, I'm Andrew, a husband, father of two, software engineer, musician. 

Most of my life I've been a Christian, however as I get older there are things I struggle with as I realise more and more that life is not black and white and as I try to see and understand things from other people's point of view. I believe we should treat eachother as we wish to be treated. I believe all human beings are pricelessly valuable, beautiful, flawed and vulnerable, all with huge potential and capable of both good and evil.

I have been a software engineer for quite a while, you can see my employment history on LinkedIn. I have worked in small companies with under 10 employees to a trading fund of the MOD with over 1300 employees and currently at an award winning Fintech Bank! I have worked on my own and in teams of up to 8. All the companies I have worked for have had good points and bad points and I have formed some strong opinions accordingly. _I love C#_, working in teams, mentoring others, architecture, dotNetCore, finding elegant solutions to problems, building distributed microservice based systems, tools such as Eventstore, ElasticSearch, Consul.
I am very interested in DDD, clean architecture and Event Sourcing.

I love music. I love the creativity and collaboration. I love a funky groove where drummer and bassist are clearly having fun! 
I play 6 string bass fairly well, I dabble with guitars and keyboards and very occaisionally with drums/cajon etc.
I love music technology, whether it's live sound or recording.
I wanted to pusue a career in music when I was younger, but I have spent enough hours in the studio with a terrible headache to realise that I would have spoiled an enjoyable hobby!

I also enjoy lifting wieghts to improve my fitness, shooting air rifles with my son, diy around the house and making things in my shed.
